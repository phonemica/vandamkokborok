Data collected as part of a lexicostatistical analysis of Barish (Bodo-Garo) languages. 

This dataset includes four clanlects of Kokborok as spoken in Tripura, India, as well as nearly collected data on Bodo `bodo1269` as spoken in Kokrajhar. The Kokborok dialects represented here are Kau Bru Reang `hala1254`, the Debbarma clanlect of Kokborok `debb1238`, the Rupini clanlect `rupi1234`, and the Tripura clanlect `tipp1239`.

The initial purpose of this dataset was to developed a Bayesian phylogenetic tree of the purposrted Sal language family. This study was part of the Swiss National Science Foundation _Sinergia_ project #CRSII5_183578 "Out of Asia" conducted at the Institut für Vergleichende Sprachwissenschaft, Universität Zürich.

## Concepts & elicitation

An original concept list was provided to speakers from each of the language varieties. However, in many cases, additional terms were volunteered, which have been included here. Numerals were provided for Bodo, but not for the Kokborok varieties. Therefore, there is a degree of inconsistency in coverage. Some concepts were also unknown to the speakers of one clanlect but not another, further contributing to the inconsistency.

Speakers were asked to provide the most basic term for the English concept given, with no intervention from the data collectors regarding the suitibility of the terms provided. This was done intentionally in order to account for potential researcher biases toward cognacy in previously published Kokborok datasets.
